# WeatherPy

## Overview of Project
PLANMYTRIP is a top travel technology company that specializes in internet-related services in the hotel and lodging industry.  I have been asked by the head of analysis for the user interface team to assist in collecting and presenting data for customers via the search page, which customers will then filter based on their preferred travel criteria in order to find an ideal hotel, anywhere in the world.  After providing analysis, visualizations and presentations for the initial search page project the head of analysis for the user interface team and their beta testers have given their sign of approval.  After doing so they next recommended that I add the weather description to the weather data to enhance the customer search and filter experience.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to add the weather description to the weather data and enhance the PlanMyTrip app.  Once completed the company beta testers will use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels.  The beta tester will choose four cities from the list of potential travel destinations to create a travel itinerary. After the four cities are selected I will use Google Maps Directions API to create a travel route between the four cities and a marker layer map.

## Summary

### The Addition of Weather Data and Multi-City Itineraries
Adding the enhancements provides the customer with the ability to search for travel experiences and itineraries with their preffered weather applied.  Examples of the enhanced customer search and filtering functionality are as follows:
